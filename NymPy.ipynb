    "Numpy is the fundamental package for numeric computing with Python. It provides powerful ways to create, store, and/or manipulate data, which makes it able to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases. This is also the foundation that Pandas is built on, which is a high-performance data-centric package that we will learn later in the course.\n",
